# Query Optimizer Competition

<p>The point of this project was to improve the basic query optimizer we were given from a competition in CS 186 in order to reduce the IOs on a set of workloads.</p>
The improvements I have added are:
- Implemented LIFO and MRU buffer replacement policies
- Implemented INLJ, LeapfrogJoin

I plan on adding:
- Duplicate key support in the B+ Tree
- Implementing Leapfrog**Trie**join
